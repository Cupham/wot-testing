This directory contains a snapshot of Thing Descriptions generated by the [Virtual Things Adapter](https://github.com/WebThingsIO/virtual-things-adapter/) of [WebThings Gateway](https://github.com/WebThingsIO/gateway/), which showcases the capabilities from the WebThings [schema repository](https://webthings.io/schemas/). These same schemas are used by around 100 gateway [add-ons](https://api.webthings.io:8443/addons/info) which expose real smart home devices (using a variety of different smart home protocols such as Zigbee, Z-Wave and HomeKit) to the Web of Things.

The Thing Descriptions in this directory are generated by the current master branch of WebThings Gateway at the time of the PlugFest, which is in the process of being modified to be W3C compliant. The current set of TDs therefore do not validate as valid W3C WoT Thing Descriptions. The [w3c-compliance](https://github.com/WebThingsIO/gateway/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aw3c-compliance) label in the issue tracker tracks remaining known W3C compliance issues which are yet to be resolved. Please report any other compliance issues you discover in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/WebThingsIO/gateway/issues).

For an overview of the current known compliance of WebThings with the W3C WoT Thing Description 1.1, WoT Profile and WoT Discovery specifications, please see the [March 2022 WebThings W3C Compliance Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NmoZ61iVEfIw6rhRwsCwTrq__eN137ROHzJjobWNPZo/edit?usp=sharing).
